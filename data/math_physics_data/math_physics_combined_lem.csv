humble probably misguided investigation connections additive identity non standard analysis,hi last night decided start watching youtube video yes bored notion something unfamiliar already convinced multiple arguments drawn comments section unsurprisingly number dumbfounded people arguing concept decided try explain principle saw using perhaps clumsy visual metaphor trying zoom line able see difference emerge two ostensible points matter scale one zoomed course speaking rigorously math triggering fuck enthusiasts professionals alike attempted draft response would rigorously outline trying express turned much depth consideration topic originally planned decided going torn shreds something something actually represents something reasoning intuition comes math become aware gotchas way present topic would stand learn mainly course started draw connections subjects math interested like non standard analysis probably much controversial could stand someone knowledgeable subject review hope form frustrating way presented instead working directly quantities proof use geometrical concepts points midpoints line segments defined along single cartesian axis case would easily translatable conventionally algebraic language hope stands unclear present thank cartesian axis define two points b c different points suppose midpoint line segment ab let us define coordinate expansion coordinate b given length segment must equal length segment mb define mb ab know sub segments equal due definition midpoint also substitute ab therefore ab b equivalent expressing could present length ab given set ought equal ab therefore length line segment divided contradiction assuming b starts present imagine finite number say divided would equal good add another last digit lets try operation infinitely small quantity divided would apparently equal definition ellipses established entails every iteration decimal expansion last decimal included ellipses therefore following definition decimal expansion small quantity reminded could write ellipses supposed count every number last decimal contradiction equivalent saying equal quotient greater nonsensical consider last digits either number would normally agree generally would agree positive non zero number x greater x implies one two things either number taking form n n numerical digit impossible numbers special properties separate finite number less e separate decimal number way resolve contradiction established modifying original premise less b premise less equal b one solution case presented length segment ab divided equal length segment located coordinate coordinate b distance b likewise midpoint b distances b also solves problem number satisfies equation x x words b point primarily cannot conceive non zero positive number smaller without running contradiction possible conceive number iteration included ellipses truly infinite consequence becomes impossible define decimal representation rational numbers would claim example finite number decimal places n n times equivalent would decide number happens would add quantity smaller alternatively would construct logically consistent way handle cases could quantity smaller infinite decimal expansion finite number turns possible consequence define mean smaller much similar way would define number less square root negative number construct new set numbers define properties ways interact existing numerical sets non standard analysis defining hyperreal numbers defines set infinitesimal numbers larger hr smaller every positive real number defined special case infinitesimal reals alternatively non standard analysis imagines dimension infinitesimal numbers anchored every real number included point intersection set infinitesimals hr r smaller larger stop adequate ways treat matter define logic would reason philosophically would argue closely related additive identity arithmetic principle implies one way define identity number e closer number number sense infinitely close within set put another way captures essence proof attempted impossible formalize difference two supposed numbers one led conclude number extent one formalize difference cannot defined difference quantity domain must therefore difference kind e existing another domain run contradiction try imagine positive number smaller could productive instead pose become smaller case fact exit domain r become larger different kind numerical axis intersecting r number crosses threshold attempts become smaller r thing refers threshold crossed number becomes closer given number r possible

accept professors tell difficulty always tried approach everything life lens intuition seems run contrary kind person also get little upset professors talk topic approached several subject intuition qm either get ignored flat told question bothers also always thought science questioning everything however comes questioning intuition qm always comes feeling qm religion dare scrutinize entire thing left really knowing quantum mechanics head understand qm tested many times one successful theory physics believe science deeply would never majored physics would trust science life came still think qm still try make sense although made strides cannot fully shake feeling something wrong quantum mechanics despite successful also cannot rule maybe problem maybe intuition end thought tend cope subject sometimes fighting intuition telling something wrong yet also still wary completely trust qm theory reading,expected accept qm without questioning undergrad physic major senior year university took upper div qm class year ago still feel uneasy class thing still coming afterwards knew entering class going introduced subject wave particle duality entanglement superposition however taking class seeing raw math afraid admit definitely confused time kinda shocked already knew topic going introduced going thought going able accept move happen way one full year later still difficulty internalizing accepting consequence qm example long class thinking double slit experiment hit whole new way thought daydreamed experiment prior qm class think ever fully realized significance afterwards know electron indivisible particle even shooting single electron time pair slit interference pattern still obtained know quantum particle exhibit wave particle duality something accept however must also mean somehow single indivisible electron going slit interfering start bother one reason became physic major enjoy breaking concept reach level intuition quantum mechanic hand seems completely break intuition time know ought accept professor tell difficulty always tried approach everything life lens intuition seems run contrary kind person also get little upset professor talk
