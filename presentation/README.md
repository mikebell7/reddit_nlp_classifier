### Presentation
Note that the results cited in the presentation were obtained by running the same analysis on a slightly bigger set of data (~4400 examples). When preparing the code for final submission, the methodology was the same, but we chose to use a smaller set of data/parameter grids to save computation time. There were no significant differences in the results in either case.
